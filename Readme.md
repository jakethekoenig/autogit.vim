# AutoGit

This is a likely ill advised plugin. The plugin automatically calls git pull when files containing +GITAUTOPULL are edited and automatically runs git add, git commit, git push when files containing +GITATOPUSH are written. The idea is to make it easy to keep files like notes or dotfiles in sync. Obviously don't use this plugin if you're using git to collaborate.

# Roadmap

I plan to add support for git project level configuration files.
